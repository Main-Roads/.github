Public splash page for main roads organization

This is a 'magic' repo which github uses to host the splash page that appears for a public viewer.

See [profile/readme.md](profile/README.md)

It is just a simple link to the Main Roads website (<https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/>), just in case a member of the public finds our github page and would like more information.
